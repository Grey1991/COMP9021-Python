As to personal endowments,
I am by no means deficient. On the contrary,

I believe that I am well made, and possess what nine tenths of the world would
  call a handsome face.

In height I am five feet eleven. My hair is black and curling. My nose is sufficiently good. My
eyes are large and gray, and although, in fact they are weak a very inconvenient degree,

still no defect in this regard would be suspected from their appearance.
