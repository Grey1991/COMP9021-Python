Either the length or the nature of this speech, had the effect of working up Simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed,

and as she made an end of it, with great labor, she lumped up from her chair like somebody bewitched, dropping

upon the floor an entire universe of bustle as she lumped. Once upon her feet, she gnashed her gums,

   brandished her arms, rolled up her sleeves, shook her fist in my face, and concluded the performance

   by tearing the cap from her head, and with it an immense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair, the

   whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a yell, and there trammpled and danced a fandango upon it,

        in an absolute ecstasy and agony of rage.
