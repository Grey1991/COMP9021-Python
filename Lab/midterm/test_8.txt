I dispute the availability,
and thus the value, of that
reason which is cultivated
in any especial form other than
the abstractly logical. I dispute,
in particular, the reason educed
by mathematical study. The mathematics
are the science of form and quantity,
mathematical reasoning is merely logic
applied to observation upon form and quantity.
The great error lies in supposing that
even the truths of what is called pure
algebra, are abstract or general truths. And
this error is so egregious that I am confounded
at the universality with which it has been received.
Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general
  truth. What is true of relation is often grossly false in regard
  to morals, for example. In this latter science it is very usually
  untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In
  chemistry also the axiom falls. In the consideration of motive
  it falls, for two motives, each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united,
  equal to the sum of their values apart. There are numerous

  other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of
  relation. But the mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit,
  as if they were of an absolutely general applicability, as the world indeed imagines them to

be.
